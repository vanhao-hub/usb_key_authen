MCUboot in MCUXpresso SDK
=========================

MCUboot in MCUXpresso SDK is a fork of the original project that aims to integrate HW features that haven't yet been covered by the upstream code.

Currently these are:
 - flash remapping techniques for zero-overhead image swapping
 - support for encrypted XIP
 - use of NXP's SB3 file
