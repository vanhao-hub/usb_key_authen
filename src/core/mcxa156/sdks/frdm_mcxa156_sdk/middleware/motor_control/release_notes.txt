Release notes
=============

Release notes for the motor-control middleware group of applications released together with the
MCUXpresso SDK. The latest documentation for the motor control SDK examples is available on [MCUXpresso SDK for Motor Control](https://www.nxp.com/sdkmotorcontrol) web.


MCUXpresso SDK 25.06.00, Motor control middleware v3.1.0
========================================================

	Leading platforms:
	- mc_pmsm_snsless: LPCXpresso860-MAX, LPCXpresso55S69-EVK, MC56F80000-EVK, TWR-MC55F8200, FRDM-MCXE247
	- mc_pmsm_enc: MIMXRT1170-EVKB, MIMXRT1180-EVK, FRDM-MCXA153, FRDM-MCXA156, FRDM-MCXA346, FRDM-MCXN236, FRDM-MCXN947, 
	  LPCXpresso55S36-EVK, MC56F81000-EVK, MC56F83000-EVK, TWR-MC56F8400
	- mc_pmsm_enc_iopamp: LPCXpresso55S36-EVK
	- mc_pmsm_enc_dual: LPCXpresso55S36-EVK
	- mc_pmsm_servo: i.MX943-EVK
	- mc_pmsm_servo_dual: i.MX943-EVK
	- mc_bldc: MIMXRT1170-EVKB, LPCXpresso55S36-EVK

	What is new:
	- Servo control loops with zero cancellation and feed-forward.
	- MCAT adjusted for servo control loops.
	- mc_pmsm_servo and mc_pmsm_servo_dual examples demontrating Industrial Servo (leading platform i.MX943).

	Known issues:
	- FRDM-MCXA153 - Due to CPU load issues is FCTRL[RWSC] configuration out of specification
	- FRDM-MCXA156 - Due to CPU load issues is FCTRL[RWSC] configuration out of specification
	- Encoder driver which uses Tracking Observer has hardcoded contstants
	- Some newer versions of FRDM-LVPMSM motor schield is populated with different switching transistors.
	  Therefore, increased deadtime might be needed to avoid power stage overheating.
	- Version of motor control components is not correctly updated to v3.1.0 in CMakeLists.txt (GitHub) and SW-Content-Register.txt (MCUXpresso SDK Package) files.
