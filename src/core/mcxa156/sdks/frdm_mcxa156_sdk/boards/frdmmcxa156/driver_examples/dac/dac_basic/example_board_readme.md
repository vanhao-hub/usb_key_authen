Hardware requirements
=====================
- Type-C USB cable
- FRDM-MCXA156 Board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
DAC output pin: J2-9(P2_2)

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect the type-C USB cable between the PC host and the USB ports on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for the serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
   the demo.
5. A multimeter may be used to measure the DAC output voltage.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the MCU-Link terminal like:

DAC basic Example.
Please input a value (0 - 4095) to output with DAC: 200
Input value is 200
DAC out: 200

Then user can measure the DAC output pin to check responding voltage.
