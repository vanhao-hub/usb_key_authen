# aoi_io_and

## Overview
The AOI IO_AND demo application demonstrates the use of IO and AOI peripherals.
The example Use the two IO as the input of the aoi function: AOI_OUT = (IO0 & IO1). 
When IO0 and IO1 are both high level, the AOI_OUT is high level.
When any of IO is low level, the AOI_OUT is low level.
The purpose of this demonstration is to show how to use the AOI driver in the SDK software.
